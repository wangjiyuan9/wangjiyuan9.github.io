	<h3>Research Interests</h3>
	<p>
		My research interests focus on leveraging deep learning for 3D geometric perception. I am enthusiastic about exploring CV foundation models or tools such as GAN, Stable Diffusion, FLUX, Qwen-VL, VGGT, etc., and successfully integrating them into my research to achieve impressive results.
		The specific intersts are listed below:
